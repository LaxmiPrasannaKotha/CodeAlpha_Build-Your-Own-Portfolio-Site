  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a recent Computer Science and Engineering graduate with a strong passion for 
  technology, problem-solving, and continuous learning. Throughout my academic journey, 
  I have built a solid foundation in programming languages like Java, Python, and C++, 
  along with hands-on experience in web development, data structures, algorithms, and 
  database management. I have worked on academic and personal projects that reflect my 
  ability to apply theoretical concepts to real-world solutions. As a quick learner and 
  team player, I am eager to begin my professional journey in a challenging and 
  growth-oriented environment where I can contribute to innovative software development 
  and keep evolving as a tech professional..</p>

      <h3>IoT-based Pet Feeder</h3>
      <p>The IoT-based Pet Feeder and Pet Tracker is a smart solution designed to automate 
      pet feeding and monitor pet activity remotely.
It uses sensors and a microcontroller (like Arduino or Raspberry Pi) to dispense food at
scheduled times.
The tracking system uses GPS and IoT modules to provide real-time location updates of the pet.
A mobile or web app interface allows owners to control feeding times and track movement conveniently.
This project enhances pet care through automation, safety, and remote monitoring using IoT technology..</p>

      <h3>ML-based Drug Recommendation</h3>
      <p>The ML-based Drug Recommendation System is designed to assist in critical medical situations 
      by suggesting appropriate medications quickly.
It analyzes patient symptoms, medical history, and emergency conditions using machine learning algorithms.
The system is trained on medical datasets to ensure accurate and context-aware drug recommendations.
A user-friendly interface enables doctors or emergency responders to receive instant suggestions.
This solution aims to support faster decision-making and improve patient outcomes during emergencies..</p>
